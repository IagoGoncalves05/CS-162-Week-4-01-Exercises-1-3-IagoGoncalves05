************************
EXERCISE 1 INSTRUCTIONS:  
************************

Implement a class called Triangle that inherits from GeometricObject.  
private class members:

double base;
double height;

public class memebers:

Triangle(double base, double height);
double getArea();

Google the formula for triange area if you don't know it

Run the Exercise 1 self test to ensure you implemented the class correctly

Save your working code by going to version control, create a git repo, and commit your code with "Exercise 1" as the comment.

************************
EXERCISE 2 INSTRUCTIONS:  
************************

Don't start this until you get to Exercise 2 in the slides.

Redefine the toString() function for the Triangle class such that it returns the string "Triangle Object"

Make sure the Exercise 2 self test passes (the Exercise 1 test will no longer pass, but that is ok)

Commit your code with "Exercise 2" as the comment.

************************
EXERCISE 3 INSTRUCTIONS:  
************************

Add getArea() to the GeometricObject class as an abstract function

Update GeometricObject::printObject such that it prints the area if (and only if) the geometric object passed in is a Triangle. The format should be "Area: 25" on it's own line (exactly as the cout statements for color, filled, etc).

The Exercise 3 input/output test should pass when you are finished. Uncomment the Exercise 3 test code in main() before testing.

Commit with the comment "Exercise 3".
